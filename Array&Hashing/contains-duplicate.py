   GitHub Copilot: This is a Python class called `Solution` that contains a single method called `containsDuplicate`. The method takes in a list of integers called `nums` and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the list contains any duplicate values.

The method first creates an empty set called `hashset`. It then iterates through each integer in the `nums` list using a `for` loop. For each integer, it checks if it already exists in the `hashset` set using the `in` keyword. If it does, then the method immediately returns `True` because a duplicate has been found. If it doesn't, then the integer is added to the `hashset` set using the `add` method.

If the `for` loop completes without finding any duplicates, then the method returns `False` because no duplicates were found.

Overall, this is a simple and efficient solution to the problem of checking for duplicates in a list of integers. The use of a set allows for constant-time lookups and insertions, making this algorithm run in O(n) time complexity. 

To improve the readability of the code, the variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `hashset` could be renamed to `unique_nums` to better reflect its purpose. Additionally, adding comments to explain the purpose of the code and the reasoning behind certain decisions could make the code easier to understand for other developers.
